# xapi-generator

This script generates a stream of random actions in the [xAPI format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_API_(Tin_Can_API)) and puts them into an [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) index.
The script was built to demonstrate the power of the ELK stack ([Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash) [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana)) as a tool for interactive and real-time [learning analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_analytics) during
my [LASI 2016](http://lasi16.snola.es) (Learning Analytics Summer Institute) Workshop.
